# GiffySearch 🌟
Welcome to the GiffySearch, a GIF Semantic Search repository! 🚀 This project enables you to search for GIFs based on their meaning through a powerful combination of advanced technologies.

### 🔍 How It Works
1. Text to Embeddings: Uses Sentence Transformers to convert your search queries and GIF descriptions into meaningful vector embeddings. 🧠
2. Efficient Search: Leverages Pinecone which is a vector database to index and retrieve the most relevant GIFs quickly based on their semantic similarity. 🔎
3. Data Handling: NumPy and Pandas are used to manage and process data efficiently, ensuring smooth handling of large datasets. 📊
4. User Interface: Streamlit provides an interactive and user-friendly interface to facilitate seamless search experiences. 🎨
  
### 🔧 Technologies Used
* Sentence Transformers: For generating text embeddings
* Pinecone: For vector search and retrieval
* Streamlit: For the frontend application
* Embeddings Retrieval: For precise and contextually relevant search results
* NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulations
* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
  
### 🛠 Features
- Search GIFs by Meaning: Find GIFs that match the context of your query.
- Interactive UI: User-friendly Streamlit interface for seamless search experiences.

### 🏗️ Getting Started
